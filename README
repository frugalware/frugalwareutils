= Frugalware Utilities.
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos-at-frugalware-dot-org>

== Status

This package contains several menu-driven utilities to make the post-install
configuration of a Frugalware system easier.

The following components are available at the moment:

* grubconfig
* mouseconfig
* netconfig
* raidconfig
* timeconfig
* xconfig
* xwmconfig

All of these can be listed and started from the central `setup` command.

== Requirements

- To use this utilities, you need:

  * GLib >= 2.0
  * ncurses
  * libparted
  * libpacman

- To build them, you need libdialog.

- Optional dependencies:

  * asciidoc for user documentation
  * po4a for localized user documentation
  * doxygen for API documentation

== How to set it up

=== If you got the sources from git

First, you need to do a `make prepare` first.

Second, if you want to get the translations from git as well, then you
need to:

----
$ git clone git://git.frugalware.org/pub/other/translations
----

You are expected to do this in `$HOME/git`, but you can overwrite this
path using the `PO_DIR` make variable.

=== The usual part

You probably want to use these utilities before `/usr` is available, so the
recommended commandline switches are:

----
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sbindir=/sbin --libdir=/lib \
	--libexecdir=/usr/libexec
$ make
# make install
----

== What needs to be done (aka. TODO)

- Let `netconfig start/stop` more verbose (maybe some initscript-like
  OK/FAILED?)

== I would like to have support for ...

If something does not work, then please report the issue to the
http://bugs.frugalware.org/[bug tracking system].

== Known bugs

- None at this time.
