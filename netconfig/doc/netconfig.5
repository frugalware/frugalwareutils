.TH netconfig 5 "January 18, 2006" "Frugalware 0.4" ""
.SH NAME
/etc/sysconfig/network/ \- configuration of network interfaces
.SH CONFIGURATION
Every file in /etc/sysconfig/network represents a network profile. When
netconfig invoked with the start paramter, then the profile named 'default'
(/etc/sysconfig/network/default) will be read. This profile is divided into
sections or \fIinterfaces\fP.  Each section defines an interface that netconfig
should initialize. The exception to this is the \fIoptions\fP section,
which defines global options.
.TP
.SH Example:
.RS
.nf
[options]
dns = 157.181.177.34

[eth0]
options = 192.168.1.102 netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway = default gw 192.168.1.1
.fi
.RE
.SH CONFIG: OPTIONS
.TP
.B "dns = <ip>"
Explicitely defines dns addresses (ie. when using a static ip). Multiple usage is ok.
.TP
.B "domain = <domain>"
Defines the local domain name. If defined more than once, the first will be used.
.TP
.B "desc = <description>"
A brief description of this network profile. Used by netconfig.
.TP
.B "adsl_username = <username>"
If you have an adsl (pppoe) connection, your adsl username.
.TP
.B "adsl_password = <password>"
If you have an adsl connection, your adsl password.
.TP
.B "adsl_interface = <interface>"
If you have an adsl connection, the Ethernet interface connected to the DSL modem.
.SH CONFIG: INTERFACES
Each section defines an interface.
The interface name is defined by the string within square brackets (eg, the two
above are 'eth0' and 'eth1'). The available directives:
.TP
.B "options = <ip> [netmask <netmask> [broadcast <broadcast>]"
Defines the ip address, netmask and broadcast address of the interface.
Multiple usage is ok for eth0:1, eth0:2, etc. See the other format of this
directive for dhcp.
.TP
.B "opions = dhcp"
Use dhcp for this interface. When this format is used, the other "options" lines are ignored.
.TP
.B "pre_up = <command>"
.TP
.B "post_up = <command>"
.TP
.B "pre_down = <command>"
.TP
.B "post_down = <command>"
The synatax of these directives are the same: you can define there commands to be executed
before the interface is up, after the interface is up, before it is down, and after,
respectively. Multiple usage is ok, the commands are executed in the specified order.
.TP
.B "mac = <mac address>"
Overwrites the mac address of the card. If defined more than once, the first will be used.
.TP
.B "essid = <essid>"
Set the ESSID (or Network Name - in some products it may also be called Domain ID) for
wireless network adapters. If defined more than once, the first will be used.
.TP
.B "gateway = [default gw] <ip>"
Route packets via a gateway. NOTE: The specified gateway must be reachable first. If the
"default gw" prefix is used, then adds a default route. If defined more than once,
the first will be used. If using dhcp, then this directive is ignored.
.TP
.B "key = <key>"
Used to manipulate encryption or scrambling keys and security mode for wireless networks.
Examples:
.RS
.nf
key = 0123-4567-89
key = [3] 0123-4567-89
key = s:password [2]
key = [2]
key = open
key = off
key = restricted [3] 0123456789
key = 01-23 key 45-67 [4] key [4]
.fi
.RE
.TP
.B "dhcp_opts = <options>"
These options are passed to the dhcp client daemon. The default is "-t 10". You may want to
specify here the dhcp hostname, then you'll need "-t 10 -h <hostname>".
